      "      Boracay Island was originally home to the Ati tribe. Boracay is part of Aklan Province, which became an independent province on April 25, 1956. Formerly undiscovered, it wasn't till the 1970s that tourism began to develop in Boracay, and the island became popular with backpackers in the 1980s.\n\n       The name Boracay is attributed to different origins. One story says that it is derived from the local word “borac” which means white cotton with characteristics close to the color and texture of Boracay’s white sugary and powdery sand. Another credits the name to local words “bora,” meaning bubbles, and “bocay,” meaning white. Yet another version dating back to the Spanish era says the name is derived from “sagay,” the word for a shell, and “boray,” the word for seed.";
